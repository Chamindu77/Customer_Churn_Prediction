This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn can help businesses retain customers by addressing the reasons why customers might leave.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 12 feature columns:

- **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer
- **Age**: The age of the customer
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Tenure**: Duration in months for which a customer has been using the company's products or services
- **Usage Frequency**: Number of times that the customer has used the companyâ€™s services in the last month
- **Support Calls**: Number of calls that the customer has made to the customer support in the last month
- **Payment Delay**: Number of days that the customer has delayed their payment in the last month
- **Subscription Type**: Type of subscription the customer has chosen
- **Contract Length**: Duration of the contract that the customer has signed with the company
- **Total Spend**: Total amount of money the customer has spent on the company's products or services
- **Last Interaction**: Number of days since the last interaction that the customer had with the company
- **Churn**: Binary label indicating whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0)
